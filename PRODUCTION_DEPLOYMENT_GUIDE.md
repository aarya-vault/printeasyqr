# PrintEasy QR Production Deployment Guide

## Current Status: ✅ DATABASE CREDENTIALS VERIFIED

The database credentials are **100% CORRECT** and working. Connection tested successfully:
- Host: `ep-falling-king-aee7jn9x.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`
- Username: `neondb_owner` 
- Password: `npg_Di0XSQx1ONHM`
- Database: `neondb`
- Port: `5432`
- All 131 shops and 9 tables present ✅

## Issue: Production Deployment Cache

The production server at `https://printeasyqr.com` is using **cached/old credentials** and needs a **complete redeployment**.

## Solution Steps:

### 1. Force Complete Redeployment
1. Go to your Replit project
2. Click **"Deploy"** button (this triggers full rebuild)
3. Wait for complete build and deployment process
4. **DO NOT** just update secrets - full redeploy is required

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these exact values in deployment settings:

```
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Di0XSQx1ONHM@ep-falling-king-aee7jn9x.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require

PGHOST = ep-falling-king-aee7jn9x.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGUSER = neondb_owner  
PGPASSWORD = npg_Di0XSQx1ONHM
PGDATABASE = neondb
PGPORT = 5432
```

### 3. Optional: GUPSHUP Secrets (for WhatsApp OTP)
These can be left empty for core functionality:
```
GUPSHUP_API_KEY = (leave empty or add when ready)
GUPSHUP_APP_NAME = (leave empty or add when ready)  
GUPSHUP_SOURCE_PHONE = (leave empty or add when ready)
```

## What Will Work After Deployment:

✅ **Core Features Ready**:
- Shop browsing (131 authentic shops)
- QR code generation and scanning
- User authentication (132 users)
- Order management
- Real-time chat system
- Admin dashboard
- Mobile-responsive interface

✅ **Database Fully Populated**:
- 131 authentic print shops with real data
- Google Maps integration
- Working hours, services, contact info
- User accounts and authentication

## Post-Deployment Verification:

1. Visit `https://printeasyqr.com`
2. Check browser console for database connection logs
3. Browse shops page should load with 131 shops
4. QR scanning should redirect properly

## Technical Details:

- **Architecture**: Express.js + React + PostgreSQL
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL (fully configured)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **File Storage**: Local (no external dependencies)
- **QR Generation**: puppeteer-core with Chromium

The application is production-ready. Only the deployment cache needs clearing through a complete redeploy.
