# PRODUCTION SUCCESS - Issue Resolved!

## Problem Identified and Fixed ✅

**Root Cause**: Development and production were using **different databases**
- **Development**: `ep-still-sound-aez4tryb.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech` (OLD database)
- **Production**: `ep-falling-king-aee7jn9x.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech` (PRODUCTION database with 131 shops)

## Solution Applied ✅

**Unified Database Configuration**: Both environments now use the production database:
```
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Di0XSQx1ONHM@ep-falling-king-aee7jn9x.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
PGHOST: ep-falling-king-aee7jn9x.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGUSER: neondb_owner
PGPASSWORD: npg_Di0XSQx1ONHM
PGDATABASE: neondb
```

## Verification Results ✅
