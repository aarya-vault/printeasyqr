## Implementation Details

### Current Database Configuration

3. **Simplified Management**: One database to maintain and backup
4. **Production-Ready**: All 10 Google Maps shops available in production immediately

### Database Environment Configuration
```javascript
// src/config/database.js - Unified for all environments
const getDatabaseUrl = () => {
  return process.env.DATABASE_URL || 
         process.env.NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL ||
         `postgresql://${process.env.PGUSER}:${process.env.PGPASSWORD}@${process.env.PGHOST}:${process.env.PGPORT}/${process.env.PGDATABASE}?sslmode=require`;
};
```

### Production-Safe SSL Configuration
```javascript
dialectOptions: {
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? {
    require: true,
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  } : false
}
```
