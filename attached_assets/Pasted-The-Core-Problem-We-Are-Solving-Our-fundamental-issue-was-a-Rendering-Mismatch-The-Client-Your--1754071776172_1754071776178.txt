The Core Problem We Are Solving
Our fundamental issue was a "Rendering Mismatch."

The Client: Your React app, running in the user's browser, perfectly renders the component with all its styles, fonts, and JavaScript-injected icons.

The Server: Our previous Puppeteer setup was trying to recreate that component from a separate HTML template. This recreation was imperfect and failed to account for subtle timing issues with fonts and scripts like lucide-react.

This mismatch is the source of all the visual bugs.

The Final Architecture: "Single Source of Truth"
Our new strategy eliminates this mismatch entirely. We will no longer ask the server to guess what the client is seeing. Instead, we will capture the final, fully-rendered HTML directly from the client's browser and send it to the server.

The server's only job is to take a perfect, literal screenshot of the exact HTML it receives. This guarantees a 1:1 match.

Execution Plan
This is a two-part implementation. I need the front-end and back-end teams to coordinate on these changes.

Part 1: Front-End Changes (React Component)
Objective: Capture the final DOM state and delegate rendering to the server.

Assign a ref: In ProfessionalQRModal.js, attach a useRef to the main <div> that contains all the visual content you want to capture. This will be our "camera target."

JavaScript

const captureRef = useRef(null);
// ...
<div ref={captureRef}>
  {/* All the visual content for the poster goes here */}
</div>
Overhaul handleDownload: This function's logic will be completely replaced.

It will no longer use html2canvas or any other client-side library.

When the user clicks download, the first step is to read the fully rendered HTML from our target: const renderedHtml = captureRef.current.innerHTML;

Construct and Send the Payload:

Create a simple JSON object: { htmlContent: renderedHtml }.

Use the fetch API to POST this JSON payload to our server endpoint (e.g., /api/generate-image).

Process the Response:

The server will respond with the raw image data (image/png).

Use response.blob() to handle the binary data.

Create a download link from this blob using URL.createObjectURL() and trigger the click.

Part 2: Back-End Changes (Node.js API with Puppeteer)
Objective: Simplify the API to be a pure "HTML-to-Image" service.

Modify the API Endpoint: The /api/generate-image endpoint will now expect a JSON payload containing the htmlContent string.

Remove Templating Logic: The old getHtmlTemplate function is now obsolete and must be removed. The server no longer needs to know how to build the HTML.

Create a Document Shell: The htmlContent we receive is just the inner part of the <body>. We need to wrap it in a full HTML document structure so Puppeteer can render it correctly. Create a simple helper function that does this:

JavaScript

const createFullHtml = (bodyContent) => `
  <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>
  <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
  </head><body>${bodyContent}</body></html>
`;
Render and Screenshot:

Use page.setContent() with the full HTML string returned from createFullHtml.

Crucially, keep the waitUntil: 'networkidle0' and await page.evaluateHandle('document.fonts.ready'); commands. These ensure that even within the HTML we receive, all external assets like images and the Tailwind CSS file are fully loaded before we take the screenshot.

Use bodyHandle.screenshot() to capture a perfectly cropped image of the content.

The Payoff: Why This Investment is Correct
Executing this plan will yield three major victories:

Pixel-Perfect Fidelity: The term WYSIWYG will finally be true. The downloaded image will be an identical twin of the on-screen preview.

Extreme Robustness: We have eliminated an entire class of unpredictable timing and rendering bugs. This system will be stable and reliable.

Team Decoupling and Maintainability: Your front-end developers can now change the design, layout, and icons in the React component freely. They will never have to worry about breaking the image generation. The back-end simply renders whatever it's given. This is a clean, professional separation of concerns.

This is our path forward. Let's execute.
