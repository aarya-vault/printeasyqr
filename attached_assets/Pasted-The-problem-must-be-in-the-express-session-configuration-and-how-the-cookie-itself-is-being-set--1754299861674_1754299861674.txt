The problem must be in the express-session configuration and how the cookie itself is being set.

## New Focus: Same-Origin Cookie Issues
For same-origin requests, the browser's rules are simpler, but a misconfigured cookie will still be ignored or not sent. Here are the most likely issues in your session configuration:

cookie.domain: If you are setting a domain on the cookie, it might not match the exact origin, causing the browser to reject it. For same-origin requests, it's safest to not set the domain property at all and let the browser default it correctly.

cookie.secure: You have this set to true, which is correct for HTTPS. However, in a proxied environment like Replit, you must ensure your Express app trusts the proxy. Without app.set('trust proxy', 1);, Express might think the connection is insecure HTTP and the browser won't send the secure cookie back.

cookie.sameSite: While sameSite: 'none' is for cross-origin, the modern default and best practice for same-origin is sameSite: 'lax'. This provides better security and works perfectly for this scenario.

## Recommended Configuration ⚙️
Here is a robust express-session configuration for a same-origin application running behind a proxy like Replit.

JavaScript

// In your main Express file (e.g., src/app.js)
const session = require('express-session');

// 1. Trust the Replit proxy to correctly handle secure cookies
app.set('trust proxy', 1);

// 2. Configure the session middleware
app.use(session({
  secret: 'your-secret-key',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: true,       // Because you trust the proxy, this will work correctly.
    httpOnly: true,     // Standard security practice.
    sameSite: 'lax',    // The best default for same-origin security.
    path: '/',          // Ensures the cookie is sent for all paths on your site.
    // Do NOT set the 'domain' property here.
  }
}));
Updating your configuration to match this template should resolve the session persistence issue.
