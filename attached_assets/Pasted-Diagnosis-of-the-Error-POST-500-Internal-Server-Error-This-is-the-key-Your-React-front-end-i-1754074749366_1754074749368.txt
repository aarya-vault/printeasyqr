Diagnosis of the Error
POST ... 500 (Internal Server Error): This is the key. Your React front-end is working perfectly. It correctly sent the request to the server. The server received the request, started processing it, but then crashed internally. The 500 status code is the server's way of saying, "I failed in a way I wasn't prepared for."

Error downloading QR code: Error: Failed to generate QR code: This is the message from your try...catch block in the React app. It's doing its job correctly by catching the failed API request. This confirms the problem is not on the client-side.

Conclusion: The failure is 100% on the server, inside your /api/generate-image endpoint. The Puppeteer process is failing to launch or execute correctly in the Replit deployment environment.

The Root Cause: The Deployment Environment
This is a classic "it works on my machine, but not in production" problem. Here's why it's happening:

Puppeteer is not just a JavaScript library; it needs to run an entire Google Chrome browser instance. Your local computer has this and all its required system files. A fresh deployment environment like the one on Replit is a barebones Linux container. It does not have the necessary system libraries and dependencies that Chromium needs to run.

When your code calls puppeteer.launch(), the server tries to start Chrome, can't find the required files (like specific font libraries or graphics utilities), and the entire process crashes, triggering the 500 error.

Action Plan: Configure the Deployment Environment
We don't need to change our application code. We need to tell the deployment environment how to prepare itself to run our code. Here is your action plan.

Step 1: Check the Server Logs Immediately

This is your most critical first step. The 500 error is generic. Go to your Replit dashboard for this project. Find the "Console" or "Logs" for the server process. You will find a much more specific error message there from Node.js or Puppeteer. It will likely say something like:

"Failed to launch the browser process"

"error while loading shared libraries: libnss3.so: cannot open shared object file"

Or a similar message about a missing .so file.

This log will confirm our diagnosis.

Step 2: Create a Replit Configuration File (replit.nix)

Replit uses a configuration file called replit.nix to define the system environment. We need to create this file in the root of your project and tell it to install Puppeteer's dependencies.

Create a file named .replit and add this content:

# .replit
# This tells replit to use the nix configuration
language = "nix"
run = "npm start"
Now, create the main configuration file named replit.nix and add the following code:

Nix

# replit.nix
# This file tells the Replit environment what system packages to install.
{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    # These are the essential system libraries that Puppeteer needs to run Chromium.
    pkgs.chromium
    pkgs.nss
    pkgs.alsa-lib
    pkgs.cups
    pkgs.libxkbcommon
    pkgs.at-spi2-atk
    pkgs.libxshmfence
    pkgs.libdrm
    pkgs.mesa
    pkgs.libepoxy
    pkgs.systemd
  ];
  # Optional: Define environment variables if needed
  # env = {
  #   PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH = "${pkgs.chromium}/bin/chromium";
  # };
}
After adding these files, you must restart the Replit environment for the changes to take effect. It will now install all those packages before running your npm start command.

Step 3: Verify Puppeteer Launch Options

Ensure your puppeteer.launch() call in the server code is robust. The args are critical for server environments.

JavaScript

// This should already be in your code, but double-check it.
browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
});
Step 4: Consider Resource Limits

Be aware that Replit's free tiers have limited RAM. Launching a browser is memory-intensive. If the problem persists after fixing the dependencies, it's possible you are hitting a memory limit. The server logs would show an "out of memory" error in this case. The solution would be to move to a more powerful environment.

Follow this plan. Start with the server logs, then implement the environment configuration. This is a standard, professional process for deploying applications with complex dependencies like Puppeteer.
