This is an API authentication error, not an issue with your Vite connection or front-end code syntax.

The log clearly shows a 401 Unauthorized error. This means your back-end server is rejecting the request because it requires authentication, and your front-end application is not providing valid credentials (like a token).

What a 401 Error Means
A 401 status code is the server telling you: "I don't know who you are, and you can't access this resource until you prove your identity."

The key evidence from your log is:

status: 401

text: "{"message":"Authentication required"}"

This confirms the endpoint .../api/shops/owner/14 is a protected route, and you must be logged in to access it.

How to Fix It 🔐
You need to include an authentication token (usually a JWT, or JSON Web Token) in the headers of your API request. This token is typically obtained after a user logs in.

The standard way to send this is in the Authorization header with the Bearer scheme.

Here’s a generic example of how to modify your fetch call to include the token. You will need to adapt this to your specific code (e.g., if you're using axios or another library).

JavaScript

// Assume you have the user's token stored in localStorage after they log in
const token = localStorage.getItem('authToken');

// When you make the API call, add the Authorization header
fetch('https://.../api/shops/owner/14', {
  method: 'GET', // or 'POST', etc.
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // This is the crucial part you are likely missing
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
})
.then(response => {
  if (!response.ok) {
    // This will catch 401 errors and other failed responses
    throw new Error(`API Error: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.json();
})
.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error(error);
});
Next Steps
Check Your API Call: Find the code in your application that makes the request to /api/shops/owner/14.

Add the Authorization Header: Modify the request to include the Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' header, as shown in the example above.

Verify Token Source: Make sure you are correctly retrieving the token from wherever you store it (like localStorage or application state) after the user logs in.

Check for Expired Tokens: If you are already sending a token, it might be expired or invalid. You may need to debug your login flow to ensure a valid token is being generated and stored.
