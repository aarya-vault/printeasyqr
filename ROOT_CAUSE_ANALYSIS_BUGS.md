## Bug 1: Order Confirmation Page Redirection Failure
**Symptom:** After placing an order, users are redirected to home page instead of order confirmation page

### Root Cause
The redirection logic in `/order-confirmation/:orderId` has an aggressive countdown timer (10 seconds) that automatically redirects to the dashboard. However, the `handleGoToDashboard` function has complex fallback logic that may interfere with the initial navigation to the confirmation page itself.

**Location:** `client/src/pages/order-confirmation.tsx` lines 92-191

**Problem Code:**
```javascript
// Line 78-79: Countdown automatically triggers redirect
else if (order && countdown === 0) {
  handleGoToDashboard();
}
```

The issue is compounded by multiple fallback mechanisms attempting to redirect simultaneously, causing a race condition where the home page redirect wins.

## Bug 2: "Order Number" Terminology Still Visible
**Symptom:** Order confirmation page and other components still display "order number" instead of "queue number"

### Root Cause
The terminology update was incomplete. While the backend correctly generates queue numbers, several frontend components still use the old "order number" terminology.

**Locations:**
- `client/src/pages/order-confirmation.tsx` - No references to queue number found
- `client/src/components/order-details-modal.tsx` - May contain old terminology
- `client/src/pages/redesigned-shop-owner-dashboard.tsx` line 70 - Uses `orderNumber` field

**Missing Updates:** The dual ID system (queue numbers + public IDs) was implemented in backend but frontend components weren't fully updated to display the new terminology.

## Bug 3: Shop Open/Close Toggle Requires Double-Click
**Symptom:** Shop status toggle button requires double-click and doesn't affect order placement

### Root Cause
The toggle mutation has a logic inversion issue. When updating the shop status, the backend correctly toggles `isOnline`, but the frontend's optimistic update message is inverted.

**Location:** `client/src/pages/redesigned-shop-owner-dashboard.tsx` lines 383-388

**Problem Code:**
```javascript
onSuccess: () => {
  toast({ 
    title: shopData?.shop?.isOnline ? 'Shop Closed' : 'Shop Opened',
    description: shopData?.shop?.isOnline ? 'You are no longer accepting orders' : 'You are now accepting orders'
  });
}
```

The toast message checks the OLD status (`shopData?.shop?.isOnline`) instead of the NEW status (which is the opposite). This creates confusion and appears as if it requires double-clicking.

**Backend Code:** `src/controllers/shop.controller.js` line 345
```javascript
await shop.update({ isOnline: !shop.isOnline });
```

## Bug 4: Files Don't Appear After Upload
**Symptom:** Files upload successfully but don't appear in customer dashboard, shop owner dashboard, or order details

### Root Cause
The order creation process initializes orders with empty file arrays, and the R2/local file upload confirmation endpoint may not be properly updating the order's files field.

**Location:** `src/controllers/order.controller.js` lines 217, 673, 685, 703

**Problem Code:**
```javascript
// Line 217: Files initialized as empty array
let files = [];

// Line 685 & 703: Orders created with empty files array
files: [], // Files added separately via R2 direct upload + confirmation
```

The issue is that files are uploaded to R2/local storage AFTER order creation, but the confirmation step that should update the order's `files` field may be failing or not being called properly.

## Bug 5: File Type Validation Rejecting All Files
**Symptom:** File type validation shows "upload * file type" error despite `acceptedFileTypes=['*']`

### Root Cause
The file validation logic has a fundamental flaw when `acceptedFileTypes` is set to `['*']` (accept all files).

**Location:** `client/src/components/enhanced-file-upload.tsx` lines 84-93

**Problem Code:**
```javascript
// Line 85-86: Gets file extension
const fileExtension = '.' + file.name.split('.').pop()?.toLowerCase();
if (!acceptedFileTypes.includes(fileExtension)) {
  // Line 89: Shows error with acceptedFileTypes.join(', ')
  description: `${file.name} is not supported. Please upload: ${acceptedFileTypes.join(', ')}`,
}
```

**The Problem:** When `acceptedFileTypes = ['*']`, the code checks if the literal string `'*'` matches the file extension (e.g., `.pdf`), which will always fail. The wildcard `'*'` is never properly handled as "accept all files".

**Evidence:** Line 170 tries to handle this for the input element:
```javascript
accept={acceptedFileTypes[0] === '*' ? undefined : acceptedFileTypes.join(',')}
```
But the validation logic at line 86 doesn't have the same wildcard handling.

## Bug 6: Completed Orders Temporarily Vanish
**Symptom:** Completed orders disappear from UI then reappear automatically

### Root Cause
The dashboard has filtering logic that explicitly excludes completed orders, treating them as "historical" data that should appear in the Order History section instead.

**Location:** `client/src/pages/redesigned-shop-owner-dashboard.tsx` lines 269-275

**Problem Code:**
```javascript
const filteredOrders = orders.filter(order => {
  // Line 272: Explicitly excludes completed orders
  if (order.status === 'completed') return false;
  // ...
});
```

**The Behavior:** When an order is marked as completed, it immediately disappears from the main dashboard view. It may "reappear" if:
1. The status is changed back from completed
2. The user navigates to Order History
3. There's a delay in the status update propagation

This is actually intentional behavior for separating active vs. historical orders, but it creates a confusing UX where orders seem to vanish.

## Summary of Root Causes

1. **Order Confirmation Redirect:** Race condition between countdown timer and navigation logic
2. **Terminology Inconsistency:** Incomplete frontend updates for queue number rebranding
3. **Toggle Status Inversion:** Toast message checks old status instead of new status
4. **Empty Files Array:** Orders created with empty files, confirmation endpoint not updating properly
5. **Wildcard Validation Bug:** File type validation doesn't handle `'*'` as "accept all"
6. **Intentional Filtering:** Completed orders are deliberately hidden from main dashboard

## Severity Assessment

- **Critical (P0):** Bugs 1, 4, 5 - Block core functionality
- **High (P1):** Bug 3 - Confusing UX that affects business operations
- **Medium (P2):** Bugs 2, 6 - UI/UX issues that don't block functionality

## Recommended Fix Priority

1. Bug 5 (File validation) - Simple fix with high impact
2. Bug 4 (Files not showing) - Core functionality blocker
3. Bug 1 (Redirect failure) - Affects user flow
4. Bug 3 (Toggle confusion) - Business operation impact
5. Bug 2 (Terminology) - Consistency issue
6. Bug 6 (Vanishing orders) - May be working as designed, needs UX review
