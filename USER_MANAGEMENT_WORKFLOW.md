## User Management System Overview

The PrintEasy admin dashboard provides comprehensive user management capabilities with proper activation/deactivation workflows and secure delete functionality.

### User Status Management

- Existing sessions are invalidated
- Orders remain accessible to shop owners but customer cannot interact

#### 2. Deactivation Process

2. Opens comprehensive AdminUserEditModal
3. Admin sees "Deactivate User" button with Ban icon
4. Click triggers PATCH request to `/api/admin/users/:id/status`
