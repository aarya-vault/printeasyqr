# FIXES APPLIED - COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION

## ✅ 1. SHOP OPEN/CLOSE STATUS - FIXED
**Solution**: Updated `shop-timing.ts` and `shop-hours-display.tsx` to handle both database formats
- Database format: `{isOpen: true, openTime: "10:00", closeTime: "20:30"}`
- Legacy format: `{open: "10:00", close: "18:00", closed: false}`
- Now correctly detects shop is OPEN during working hours

## ✅ 2. SHOP SETTINGS WORKING HOURS - FIXED
**Solution**: Updated `redesigned-shop-settings.tsx` to handle both formats
- Detects `openTime`/`closeTime` from database
- Falls back to `open`/`close` for legacy
- Shows correct times instead of "--:-- --"

## ✅ 3. FILE UPLOAD DIRECTORY - FIXED
**Solution**: Created uploads directory
- Files will now go to `/uploads/` instead of `/attached_assets/`
- Download and print will work correctly

## ✅ 4. ORDER DETAILS MODAL - ALREADY FIXED
**Solution**: Modal has stable state management
- Uses `stableOrder` state to prevent vanishing
- Updates only when actual order changes

## ✅ 5. WEBSOCKET ERROR (PORT 5001) - NOT AN ISSUE
**Explanation**: This is Vite's HMR WebSocket, not our app
- Can be safely ignored
- Our app WebSocket runs on port 5000

## VERIFICATION STEPS:
1. Shop should show as OPEN (not Closed) when isOnline=true and within working hours
2. Shop Settings should display actual times (10:00 - 20:30) not "--:-- --"
3. New file uploads should go to /uploads/ folder
4. Order details modal should stay visible when opened
5. Download and print functions should work

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Working hours interface now accepts both database and legacy formats
- Type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Backwards compatible with existing data
