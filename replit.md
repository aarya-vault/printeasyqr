# PrintEasy QR - Business Printing Platform

## Overview

PrintEasy QR is a production-ready B2B2C digital platform connecting customers with local print shops. Its main purpose is to streamline order management and communication for print shops while offering customers convenient access to printing services through two primary order flows: digital file uploads for pre-planned needs and walk-in orders for immediate service. The platform features robust admin management and a revolutionary QR generation system, focusing on connecting users without handling financial transactions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Design Philosophy
The platform adheres to a strict design policy centered around golden yellow (`#FFBF00`) and black, with a "no gradients" rule to ensure a clean, professional, and consistent visual identity. All UI elements comply with this color scheme. The design prioritizes mobile-first responsiveness, scaling elegantly across various device sizes.
