- **Availability Calculation Logic**: Updated availability checking to use proper day name calculation and time comparison in minutes for accurate open/closed status
- **QR Code Enhancement**: Added dynamic working hours display to QR codes showing Mon-Sun schedule with open/close times or "Closed" status
- **Query Invalidation**: Fixed cache invalidation to refresh all relevant shop data when working hours are updated
- **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved type errors in admin shop edit component for working hours updates

## Print Functionality Implementation (January 27, 2025)

### Comprehensive Print System
- **Print File Logic**: Opens blank window and injects HTML content with proper file rendering
- **File Type Support**: 
  - Images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, webp): Rendered with img tag and auto-print onload
  - PDFs: Rendered with embed tag for native browser PDF viewing
  - Other files: Rendered in iframe with contentWindow print
- **Print All**: Sequential printing with 3-second delays between files to prevent browser blocking
- **Fallback Timer**: 4-second fallback to ensure print dialog triggers even if onload fails
- **No Downloads**: Files render directly in browser without triggering downloads
- **Server Headers**: Content-Disposition set to inline with proper MIME types

### Technical Implementation
- **Window.open('')**: Opens blank window to avoid download behavior
- **Document.write()**: Injects complete HTML with proper styling and print triggers
- **Async/Await**: Sequential processing for Print All functionality
- **Progress Tracking**: Optional progress callback for UI feedback

The print system now reliably opens print dialogs for all supported file types without any downloads, following browser best practices for printing.

### Critical Print Fixes (January 27, 2025 - Latest)
- **Sequential Printing Strategy**: Changed from parallel to sequential printing to prevent browser popup blocking and timing issues
- **Reliable Load Detection**: Images and iframes use onload print triggers, PDFs use fallback-only for better reliability
- **Print Window Monitoring**: Added interval checking for `printWindow.closed` to detect completion accurately
- **Extended Fallback Timing**: 6-second fallback timeout for large PDF files with proper cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Individual file print failures don't stop the entire batch, with comprehensive logging
- **Perfect File Serving**: Server correctly detects file types and serves with proper Content-Type headers and inline disposition
