# PrintEasy QR - Business Printing Platform

## Overview
PrintEasy QR is a B2B2C digital platform that connects customers with local print shops to streamline order management and communication. Its primary purpose is to facilitate printing services through digital file uploads and walk-in orders. The platform includes robust admin management and a unique QR generation system, designed to connect users without handling financial transactions. The vision is to create a production-ready platform that simplifies the printing process for businesses and consumers.

## User Preferences
- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
- Configuration management: Centralized environment configuration with hardcoded database URLs
- Architecture preference: Single source of truth for all configuration via .env files

## System Architecture

### Design Philosophy
The platform adopts a clean, professional, and consistent visual identity, adhering to a strict color palette of golden yellow (`#FFBF00`) and black with a "no gradients" rule. Design prioritizes mobile-first responsiveness for elegant scaling across devices.

- **Advanced Order Management**: Sophisticated queue calculation logic focusing on active orders, role-based order creation safeguards, and comprehensive error handling.
- **One-Email-One-Shop Enforcement**: Database constraints and backend validation ensure each email address can only own one shop, with automatic duplicate cleanup and prevention systems.
- **Complete "Queue #" Rebranding**: Systematically replaced all "Order #" references with "Queue #" across the entire platform including frontend, backend, chat systems, dashboards, confirmations, and notifications.

## Database Configuration (Updated: 2025-01-18)

### Production & Development Setup  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Replit Neon managed instance)
- **ORM**: Sequelize (production-ready database management)
- **Schema**: Complete database schema created via manual migration
- **Protection**: Database sync disabled, proper indexing implemented
- **Migration Strategy**: Manual SQL migrations in `src/migrations/` directory
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Database connectivity and schema fully operational

### Deployment Build Process
- **Build Script**: `build.js` - Skips database operations during build
- **Environment Variables**: Sets SKIP_MIGRATIONS=true to prevent deployment hanging
- **Important**: Database schema must exist before deployment (no auto-migrations)

### Direct .env Configuration (Updated: 2025-08-19)
- **Single Source of Truth**: `.env` file accessed directly via process.env throughout project
- **No Configuration Wrapper**: Removed src/config/env.js centralized system per user requirement
- **Direct Environment Access**: All modules use process.env.VARIABLE_NAME directly
- **Configuration Structure**:
  - Database settings (DATABASE_URL, PGHOST, PGUSER, etc.)
  - Application settings (PORT, NODE_ENV, JWT_SECRET)
  - External services (GUPSHUP_API_KEY, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY, R2 credentials)
  - Build settings (SKIP_MIGRATIONS, DISABLE_DB_SYNC)
  - Feature flags (ENABLE_WHATSAPP_OTP, ENABLE_R2_STORAGE)
- **dotenv.config()**: Each module loads environment variables independently

### Zero-Conflict Enforcement
- Unique constraints on: shop slugs, shop emails, user emails, user phones
- Automated conflict detection and prevention
- Production-ready with full data integrity
- Password standard: All shop owners use "PrintEasyQR@2025"
- Login format: {shop-slug}@printeasyqr.com

## Recent Updates (August 20, 2025)

### ✅ CRITICAL FIX: Replit Deployment Timing Issue - RESOLVED
- **Root Cause Identified**: Replit sets environment variables AFTER Node.js process starts
- **Problem**: Sequelize was initializing with undefined credentials before Replit loaded secrets
- **Solution**: Implemented complete lazy initialization with retry logic:
  - Database connection deferred until first actual use
  - Retry mechanism if environment variables not yet available
  - All models use `getSequelize()` for lazy initialization
- **Critical Changes**:
  - `src/config/database.js`: Returns null if env vars missing, retries on next call
  - Removed problematic `sequelize` export that was undefined at module load
  - `testConnection()` uses lazy initialization
- **Test Results**: Confirmed working with late environment variable loading
- **Status**: Deployment issue fully resolved - handles Replit's async environment loading
