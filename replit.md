## Critical Production Issues Resolved (January 26, 2025 - Latest Update)

### Shop Settings Route Fix
- **Issue**: Shop settings endpoint was returning 500 error system-wide - failed from both admin panel and shop settings pages

## Print Functionality Implementation (January 27, 2025)

### Comprehensive Print System
- **Print File Logic**: Opens blank window and injects HTML content with proper file rendering
- **File Type Support**: 
  - Images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, webp): Rendered with img tag and auto-print onload
  - PDFs: Rendered with embed tag for native browser PDF viewing
  - Other files: Rendered in iframe with contentWindow print
- **Print All**: Sequential printing with 3-second delays between files to prevent browser blocking
- **Fallback Timer**: 4-second fallback to ensure print dialog triggers even if onload fails
- **No Downloads**: Files render directly in browser without triggering downloads
- **Server Headers**: Content-Disposition set to inline with proper MIME types

### Technical Implementation
- **Window.open('')**: Opens blank window to avoid download behavior
- **Document.write()**: Injects complete HTML with proper styling and print triggers
