# PrintEasy - Business Printing Platform

## Overview

PrintEasy is a comprehensive B2B2C digital platform that connects customers needing printing services with local print shops. The application provides two primary order flows: digital file uploads for pre-planned printing needs and walk-in orders for immediate service. The platform facilitates order management, real-time communication, and streamlined business operations for print shops while offering customers a convenient way to access printing services.

**Current Status (January 26, 2025)**: Production-ready application with all critical issues addressed. All major functionality working including file handling, order management, customer dashboard redesign, shop settings updates, and comprehensive loading screens throughout the platform.
