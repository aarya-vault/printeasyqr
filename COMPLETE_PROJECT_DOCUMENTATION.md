## Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Database: PostgreSQL (Neon Database URL in DATABASE_URL)
   - Admin Credentials: `ADMIN_EMAIL=its.harshthakar@gmail.com`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD=2004@Harsh`
   - JWT Secret: Auto-generated or custom JWT_SECRET

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push  # Push schema changes (no manual migrations)
   ```

4. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Starts both frontend (Vite) and backend (Express)
   ```

### Production Deployment

**Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment
**Platform**: Replit Deployments (recommended)

**Deployment Process**:
1. All production dependencies installed and configured
2. Environment variables properly set
3. Database migrations handled via `npm run db:push`
4. Static asset serving configured
5. WebSocket and HTTP server properly configured

## Authentication Flow Details

### JWT Token System
- **Token Storage**: localStorage (frontend) + HTTP-only cookies (backup)
- **Token Format**: Standard JWT with user ID, role, and permissions
- **Expiry**: 24 hours with automatic refresh capability
- **Security**: bcrypt password hashing, secure headers, CORS protection

### Session Fallback System
- **Purpose**: Handle mixed authentication scenarios
- **Implementation**: Session validation via database lookup when JWT fails
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing session-based authentication
- **User Experience**: Seamless authentication without re-login requirements

---

## Recent Critical Fixes (August 2025)

### 1. Analytics System Resolution ✅
**Issue**: Shop analytics page stuck on "Loading..." despite backend returning HTTP 200
**Root Cause**: Frontend query client not properly handling JWT authentication for analytics endpoint
**Solution**: 
- Implemented explicit query function with proper JWT token inclusion
- Fixed User model import issues in authentication middleware
- Added session-based authentication fallback for compatibility
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic

### 2. Authentication Overcomplification ✅
**Issue**: JWT verification happening unnecessarily for already logged-in shop owners
**Root Cause**: Mixed JWT/session authentication creating complexity
**Solution**:
- Streamlined authentication middleware for better performance
- Reduced excessive logging for authenticated shop owner requests
- Maintained security while improving user experience

### 3. Puppeteer CSS Loading Performance ✅
**Issue**: QR code screenshots taken before CSS fully loaded, causing incomplete visuals
**Root Cause**: Insufficient wait time (200ms) for CSS and font rendering
**Solution**:
- Increased CSS loading delay from 200ms to 2000ms
- Added image loading wait functionality
- Implemented font loading verification
- Enhanced screenshot quality and consistency

### 4. Database Schema Alignment ✅
**Previous Fix**: Updated PostgreSQL constraints to support all application order types and statuses
- Order types: `'digital'`, `'upload'`, `'walkin'`, `'file_upload'`
- Order statuses: `'new'`, `'pending'`, `'processing'`, `'ready'`, `'completed'`, `'cancelled'`
