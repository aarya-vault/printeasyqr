### Core Tables
```sql
-- Users table
users: id, phone, name, role (customer/shop_owner/admin), createdAt

-- Shops table  
shops: id, ownerId, name, slug, publicName, address, services[], equipment[], 
       workingHours (JSON), acceptingOrders, isOnline, createdAt

-- Orders table
orders: id, customerId, shopId, type (upload/walkin), status, description,
        files (JSON), totalFiles, createdAt, updatedAt

-- Messages table
messages: id, orderId, senderId, senderType, content, isRead, createdAt

-- Shop Applications table
shopApplications: id, publicOwnerName, email, password, shopName, slug,
                  publicContactNumber, ownerContactNumber, address,
                  yearsOfExperience, servicesOffered[], equipmentAvailable[],
                  workingHours (JSON), acceptWalkinOrders, status, createdAt

-- Notifications table
notifications: id, userId, title, message, type, isRead, createdAt
```

### Data Relationships
- Users (1:1) Shop Owners via ownerId
- Shops (1:N) Orders via shopId
- Users (1:N) Orders via customerId (customers)
- Orders (1:N) Messages via orderId
- Users (1:N) Notifications via userId

## Key Features Deep Dive

### 1. File Upload System
**Implementation**: Multer middleware with local storage
**Supported Formats**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG, TXT
**File Processing**:

- Original filename and MIME type preserved in database
- Server-side MIME type detection via file signatures
- Content-Disposition: inline for browser display

### 2. Print Functionality
**Core Challenge**: Print files without downloading
**Solution Architecture**:
- Window.open('', '_blank') creates blank print windows
- HTML injection with proper styling and content rendering
- File type detection for optimal rendering:
  - Images: `<img>` tags with onload print triggers
  - PDFs: `<embed>` tags for native browser PDF viewing
  - Other files: `<iframe>` with contentWindow.print()
- Sequential printing with timing controls to prevent browser blocking

### 3. Real-time Communication
**WebSocket Implementation**: Custom WebSocket server
**Features**:
- Live order status updates
- Real-time messaging between customers and shop owners
- Connection management with user-specific mapping
- Auto-reconnection handling on client side
