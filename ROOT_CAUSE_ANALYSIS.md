# ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT

## 1. SHOP OPEN/CLOSE STATUS ISSUE
**Problem**: Shop showing as "Closed" despite being online and within working hours
**Root Cause**: Working hours format mismatch
- Database stores: `{"isOpen": true, "openTime": "10:00", "closeTime": "20:30"}`  
- Frontend expects: `{"open": "10:00", "close": "20:30", "closed": false}`
- The `isShopCurrentlyOpen` function in `shop-timing.ts` looks for `todayHours.open` and `todayHours.close`
- But database provides `todayHours.openTime` and `todayHours.closeTime`

## 2. ORDER DETAILS MODAL VANISHING
**Problem**: Modal closes immediately after opening
**Root Cause**: State management issue in OrderDetailsModal
- Component already has fix attempt with `stableOrder` state
- But modal might be closing due to parent component re-render

## 3. FILE UPLOAD LOCATION ISSUE  
**Problem**: Files going to attached_assets instead of uploads folder
**Root Cause**: Upload configuration issue
- Object storage is configured but files are being saved locally
- `attached_assets/` folder has recent PDF uploads (files-1755110405559-457392235.pdf)
- `uploads/` folder is empty
- The upload middleware is saving to wrong directory

## 4. WEBSOCKET CONNECTION ERROR (0.0.0.0:5001)
**Problem**: WebSocket trying to connect to port 5001 instead of 5000
**Root Cause**: HMR (Hot Module Replacement) WebSocket from Vite
- This is NOT our application WebSocket
- It's Vite's development server trying to connect for hot reloading
- Can be ignored as it doesn't affect functionality

## 5. SHOP SETTINGS WORKING HOURS DISPLAY
**Problem**: Shows "--:-- --" for all working hours
**Root Cause**: Same format mismatch as issue #1
- Settings page expects `open`/`close` fields
- Database provides `openTime`/`closeTime` fields

## FIXES NEEDED:
1. Update working hours parsing to handle both formats
2. Fix file upload directory configuration
3. Ensure modal state persistence
4. Update shop settings to handle correct field names
